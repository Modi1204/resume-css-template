tar -xf file.tar.bz2
cd dir_name
./configure
make
sudo make install
*dir_name* is the same as file name but without file extension.

You would probobly need build-essential package before compiling.

You can install it by typing:

sudo apt-get install build-essential
Like iSeth said it's better and simpler to install Wine from repo by just typing:

sudo apt-get install wine
